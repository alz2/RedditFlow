1. You expressed a desire for minimum involvement after reporting Petry to the police, and to not want your name to be attached to this saga. With the attention your Reddit post garnered, and the publicity it generated, have you been able to achieve this?

1. Do you know how many other victims have come forward to the police (or contacted you)? Do you know how long this has been going on? I am surprised he has been able to keep doing this for so long, with so many women. Did the others not complain, or were their complaints not taken seriously by the police/university? Makes me wonder if there are other women being similarly harassed by other professors, or if Petry one of a kind. If the former, I hope this can serve as a UIUC-level #MeToo catalyst, and encourage other women to come forward.

I think you are incredibly brave for first reporting him, and then posting on Reddit when the university tried to hush this up.

It's a great facility but absolutely inadequate for fundamental understanding assessment of a class as computationally dependent as 251 is.    


  
I am a bad test taker, and will always use the whole period and end up making some bone-head mistake for half a letter grade. In that aspect, the CBTF was an incredibly bad experience for me. Three problems, most multiple parts and all or nothing methods are ineffectual. Of every quiz and it's retake, I think i passed 1, and ended the semester with a CBTF average of 40%. After the first in-class test which I scored a 95% on, I sat down with the Professor for 2 hours and discussed this very issue.   


  
Long story short... for at least the TAM series, there needs to be some sort of feedback or partial credit (beyond the built-in decreasing value scheme).

The ability the retake the exam for most of the credit is really beneficial and made the exam a lot less stressful. Manually grading for partial credit is also important. Having a CA or TA in the room or online to clarify things would be nice. It's really frustrating when you don't understand what the question is trying to ask or it's ambiguous and you can't do anything about it.

Multiple attempts for partial credit is also necessary. They don't let you use your own calculator, which is extremely stupid, so I would be cautious of anything that's calculator heavy (it was really bad for a physics exam since I didn't know how to use their calculators well and they were much worse than mine).

Teachers 4 Creatures is a service club which teaches the community more about companion animal issues. An example of this is their last event. They went to a local elementary school and taught about proper etiquette around dogs. I mentioned this group specifically because some members will bring their pets to general meetings. I believe that Teachers 4 Creatures is rather low-key, but as with any RSO, you get out of it what you put in. Here's their facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/teachers4creatures](https://www.facebook.com/teachers4creatures)  


4 Paws for Ability is originally a non-profit, service dog agency based in OH. College chapters around the US are given dogs to train and raise to be service dogs! Members who have been in the club for a long period of time and completed the necessary training will be responsible for fostering the dog while other members will help train and learn more about service dogs. I believe 4 Paws for Ability requires more commitment because training service dogs is a serious thing. Here's their facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/4PawsUIUC/](https://www.facebook.com/4PawsUIUC/)  


Lastly, volunteering for the Champaign County Humane Society! This would be your best way of spending time with dogs, but it would also be your biggest time commitment (I think?). CCHS requires that volunteers commit to working a minimum of 4 months of service and volunteer at least 3 hours per week (if more convenient, you can literally volunteer an hour a day or whatever). You obviously have to apply to be a volunteer and then attend a monthly orientation. I think the best position for you would be a dog socialization volunteer! Also if you don't drive, there is a bus that will take you near the center. I know some of the volunteers and staff who work there, and everyone is really amazing. So if you have the time, I'd recommend you try it out!

There was a Pale Ale that was always on tap and then the other would rotate seasonally. I remember a porter and a summer wheat specifically. Maybe an oatmeal stout?

As they added the patio on the west side for more tables and so on, I think they just got away from brewing beer themselves. Honestly, the in-house beers were not much of a draw on campus even in the first year. But I do remember a Herpetology conference that showed up in masse summer of 1992 when I was the only server on staff. That was a crazy day and they ALL wanted our in-house brews.

t3_bicvmz,elzqkqu,gamera72,1,2019-04-28 11:50:21,"Not sure how high-end you are looking for, but most high-end spots here tend to be small so they don’t advertise a lot of jobs, they recruit (in my limited experience watching friends move from place to place).

Lots of opportunity to do your own thing. For example, Thad Morrow opened up Bacaro years ago, sold it. (Closed now.) Now he is the chef at Naya on campus after working for Blue Apron in NY for a while. Naya is owned by the same people who own Miga and Sakanaya in town. All are small intimate places. 

Another example that is less high end, dude helped open Black Dog, then worked at Bacaro for a while, then helped open Watson’s. Now he’s back at Black Dog I think. 

So lots of options, probably less high-end than you are looking for. Strong social networks as people move from place to place depending on interest, etc.  

There’s an informal drinking frat founded decades ago called Pi Omega Omega (POO) and is still mostly composed of service industry people so lots of kitchen staff from all over town hang out and share openings with each other, etc. 

Food trucks are picking up here and some end up moving to brick and mortar (Cracked, Fernando’s, Caribbean Grill) which is another option if you don’t find something that appeals to you. You can do your own thing. 

Another thing to look at are potential places opening up. Some aren’t even built yet, but Ko-Fusion is moving, expanding. Farren’s is a popular burger joint but the owner used to manager Silvercreek and they are moving into a place that just closed with a cocktail lounge bar set up. Not sure what the revamp will be but places like that are also options of new ideas. 

Plus a college town like this has lots of niches like catering and event-driven receptions/tailgating/concerts so that is something that would be unadvertised too. 

You can google most of these places too if you want to see the spaces and menus. 

Good luck!
