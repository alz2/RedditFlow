t3_bieor1,em0rhc9,spicysalmontunaroll,1,2019-04-28 19:13:08,"I've had to do this a few times now to drop a future co-op term to add in another study term (I'm in science). For the chart on the form, you should specify the term that you're on (i.e 2A or WT3) so your advisor/ceca know what term you want and what year it's occurring in instead of 'S' and 'W'. I don't know what the dot is supposed to indicate, so I suggest you should remove it and add it the study term you'll be one. For example:

|2017|2018|2019|
|:-|:-|:-|
|(W) 2A   (S)  '.'    (F) 2B|(W) WT1      (S) 3A    (F)  WT2|(W) 3B     (S) 4A     (F) 4B|

etc...

just keep adding in the terms until you hit your last study term (you can have 5A/5B terms or just write 'extra term' in W21). Indicating that S19 is a study term is a must.

Also, I think submitting a small paragraph in a separate word document explaining the situation and why you want to switch a co-op to a study term helps to give context to your advisor/ceca. 

I've never had an issue with sequence changes forms being approved but I don't know how it varies by faculty. Submit the form asap since it often take 1-2 weeks for everything to be approved.

I also don't think someone's anecdote would be very reliable here as the program is still pretty new, so the number of spots and applicants is prone to change

Anyway, if I were to take a rough guess, the lowest average of someone who transferred to data science is probably be anywhere from 1 ~ 4 (note: this is an arbitrary figure) percent lower than the lowest average of someone who transferred to CS.

Reasoning:

- assume anybody who wants to apply to data sci will also apply to CS

- assume anybody who wants to apply to CS will also apply to data sci as a backup

- assume anybody who receives an offer to both CS and data sci will take the offer to CS

- it should be trivial to see based off these axioms that the average for the data sci transfers is lower than for CS

Reasoning for reasoning:

- [1. *The phrase ""Computer Science students"" refers to ... Students enroled in the BMath \(Data Science\) plan are not considered Computer Science students.*](http://www.ucalendar.uwaterloo.ca/1920/COURSE/course-CS.html)

- you literally pay the same tuition as a bmath data sci student but get less access to courses than a CS student, it's objectively worse to take a data sci transfer if you are admitted to CS

Disclaimers:

- programs are subject to change in the future

- my assumptions are made assuming that prospective CS/DS students are not naive",/r/uwaterloo/comments/biixkr/does_anybody_knows_the_average_of_transferring/em11hi3/,NaN,0.914,0.03,0.056

That being said, it really depends on what these companies are doing. In most established companies/product that have to deal with scale, full stack is the same as doing literally any kind of development (except going down the stack to OS/kernel level and below).

You pay an additional fee for co-op as well, it costs as much as one course does (over $700 I think) which you pay once you are admitted into the coop stream. You also have to take a mandatory course that guide you through the coop process during the study term before your first work term called PD1. PD1 is a credit or no credit sort of course, and to get the credit you need an average of 75% on the course and you also need to get a 75% on the resume that you submit to them. Throughout your work-terms you are going to have to do reports and from what I've understood you need to describe your responsibility at work and some other stuff–I have yet to do my first work term. Other than that the psych workload depends on the class, some are more demanding than others, although generally a lot of them require to do some extensive reading which can take quite a while. 

The difficulty of the courses depends on your interests/study habits and on the instructor as well, and the marking of the TA's. PSYCH 101 is heavy in terms that they teach you about all the branches of psychology. Paul Wehr was my instructor and he was really good. He knew how to keep everyone's attention. In his class we had to do a couple of long-answer questions every now and then. He gave us 5 potential questions he could ask and then he would only ask 2 of them and you have 20 minutes to complete them. The midterms were done online, I suggest that you find people that you can do them with, it's more fun and also you can split the work in terms of assigning people to read a certain chapter and take notes rather than do all of the readings yourself. The mandatory 2nd year courses are not so bad in my opinion. I find that a lot of the people in psych arts is very worried about 261 (physiological psychology). However, as long as you pay attention to the course and you take the initiative to clarify any questions that you have, then you will be alright–this applies to any course tbh. I have only taken one third year course, so I cannot tell you much about that, but I hope this helps a little bit at least.

I'm not sure if itll be the same format but for me the format was

a bunch of mini assessments online for each lesson.  Very easy and small number of questions.

Then we had 3 projects 2 assignments.

Projects were 3.3% each had few questions were kind of tricky imo.

Assignments were 10% each and has many questions but they were straight calculations so easy.

You actually have lots of time to complete everything so it wasnt a stressful course.  The assignments accumulated to 40% of my grade and the rest was the final.

I had Owen Woody   he still hasnt returned 3/5 big assignments, some that weve done back in February and I still dont have my final mark.  He's also really slow at replying to emails so when I had a 39 fever for days and 2 infections and emailed him asking for an extension  for the 10% assignment, he didnt reply for 5 days and I ended up having to take a shit ton of pain killers and medication to grind all night to finish it sick af.

Of all the courses you've listed, I personally struggled with AMATH 250 the most. When I attempted the in-class version of the course, the first month or so was a lot of review and expansion of content seen in MATH 138. This was fine until things switched gears into brand new material that had a lot of physics concepts. I personally did not take physics in high school (not to mention I failed PHYS 121 spectacularly) so I was absolutely clueless as to what the problems were asking me for. I ended up WD-ing the course before the midterm because I just knew it wasn't the course for me. If you like calculus, and have at least had some exposure to physics-based concepts, you may fair better than I did, but I would not really recommend this course otherwise.

I took CO 480 with Steven Furino back in Spring 2015, and I wrote in more detail my experiences with the course in a [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/bbpp49/hows_steve_furino_as_a_co480_prof/). I really enjoyed the course, but would not recommend it if you're not a fan of writing and large group projects.

I took CS 200 with Barb Daly in Spring 2018, and I wrote more about my experience in [this thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/a8rrt7/how_is_barbara_daly_for_cs200/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). I really, really enjoyed this course, but the workload and effort does increase towards the end of the term, so be prepared to take extra time to get things done.

I took STAT 337 with Cecilia Cotton also in Spring 2018. The course itself focuses on how to understand statistics that are presented in a health/biological context (e.g. reading various studies findings and seeing if things made sense or not). The math itself was really straightforward (be prepared for a LOT of working with two by two tables in various statistical models) and you had the opportunity to bring in your own formula sheet for exams, but the most fun/challenging part of the course though was the group poster presentations. You got together in groups of 2-4 to examine a biostatistical topic (often, but not always health related) and present 3 academic papers that study the topic in one culminating poster. Not gonna lie, presenting in front of classmates at 8:30 am (yay class scheduling) AND getting the poster printed fully by then was quite stressful despite the project itself not being as intense in workload or worth as much of the final grade as the CO 480 project was. Overall though, I enjoyed the course and I was so happy and proud of the results of that project.

As for CS 432, I took this course quite a few years ago (i.e. around 2013/2014 or so) with a different prof, so I'm really not sure if my experiences are relevant for this upcoming offering. At the time, this course involved a lot of writing and coming up with solutions to project-based scenarios based on the concepts we were looking at in class. I found it pretty tedious, but so long as you went into as much detail as possible you could do well. Exams were easier than the written assignments, mostly because they focused on ""do you know this concept well enough?"".

Overall, I would strongly suggest taking CO 480 and CS 200, with a toss-up between CS 432 and STAT 337, but hopefully with all the info provided you'll be able to make a more informed decision.

If you give someone in their 4B term moderator, they lose some effectiveness once they graduate because even if they do check the subreddit everyday, they slowly lose the connection with the school (which makes it hard, from my experience, to moderate effectively). I want to emphasize that this doesn't close the door on 4th years though, in fact, I became a mod when I was in my 4A term. If a 4th year promises to commit at least a year, then the year doesn't matter - However if its someone in their 4B that wants to mod for 4 months then call it quits, whats the point right?

In terms of the mod team making the final call - its really to give us an ""excuse"" to pick people that weren't top rated by the community. Let's say we pick 3 people - the top 2 are almost guaranteed (and this is true, based on past experience) to be the top 2 candidates with the best vote record (i.e. the community picks, not us). However, as others have mentioned, the more popular/well known redditors on the subreddit may get an advantage, so we want to reserve a spot for someone who is just as qualified by not as known to the community. In terms of the 3rd guy, yeah I'm not going to sit here and tell you that we're going to pick someone that's 180 degrees from our views, but I also believe (and maybe you disagree) we're not going to sit there and be like ""yo lets find the most twofactorial-esque (or some other mod) person and pick them &gt;:)"". Also, we'd still take into account the community feedback on each person. So that being said, I want to see what you think - do you like the idea of having the top 2 community picks + 1 person picked by the mod team?

Honestly I personally hate the hate posts or low quality bait threads. I agree with you that they have no value added to the community and generally brings the sub down. However, what's insanely difficult is where to the draw the line - We don't want to allow the community to be polluted by those type of posts, but at the same time, we don't want to step into every post and police whats being said. So far we've taken a more hands off approach, and we let the community decide the more borderline cases (via reports). The straight up racist or hate posts though - we've removed them pretty frequently and I don't remember anything too controversial that we've left up. Let me know if I'm wrong about this though.

I like the idea that there's some defined procedures instead of the current 'mods pick who they want, and great if the community agrees ahead of time'.  Because right now there's 3 picked by the mods and none by the community - right?

t3_ajgddo,em2doge,jhorbulyk,1,2019-04-29 10:52:47,"About Me:

I'm a UWaterloo Co-op Grad who graduated in 2014.  I currently work in Germany at a small software company which now hires UWaterloo Co-op students.  We had one studen in the Fall of 2018, failed to match any in Winter 2019 and now have 2 starting in Spring 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

Which co-op community you're trying to reach?

I would say the various forms of communities:

\- Individuals who have relatively managerial experience who are now managing co-op students

\- Individuals who have experience navigating UWaterloo works/CECA/WaterlooWorks/UW Application packages (employer-side) and who have any tips or tricks to share

\- Other international employers who want to talk over the international aspect of UW Coop Hiring

\- Other UW employers who want to coalesce their CECA/WaterlooWorks/etc into more constuctive feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

Why I'm asking and What Information am I trying to get?

\- I'm in the process of putting together my expectations for incoming Co-op students about what makes ""outstanding"" vs ""excellent"" vs ""very good"".  I can find a lot of resources for help on the student side of the question but relatively few resources employer-side.  I was wondering if anyone had any good templates to share on that side.

\- I know in a few weeks I will get an email from CECA asking to set up student SMART goals?  It would be nice to chat with employers who have been successful with that rubrik or whether they have some more valuable rubrik that they have found useful.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm trying to accomplish:

\- Create a community where these types of general Q&amp;A can be shared.",/r/uwaterloo/comments/ajgddo/waterlooworks_megathread_winter_2019/em2doge/,NaN,0.83,0.158,0.012

&gt; In terms of the mod team making the final call - its really to give us an ""excuse"" to pick people that weren't top rated by the community. Let's say we pick 3 people - the top 2 are almost guaranteed (and this is true, based on past experience) to be the top 2 candidates with the best vote record

I also want to backtrack a bit because after reading my initial response to you, I misspoke and that gave off the wrong impression. We WILL give the community the decision on the top two candidates. The third one would still be a highly ranked one, but lets say between the 3-6 ranked people we would pick one.

I think I emphasized too much on the mod team picking everything and that is not the intent. I personally agree that community opinion should be the #1 priority and I want to reassure you on that.

&gt; For illustration see my point #2. I think tighter moderation within defined rules is needed here. Mods disagree. Opportunity for change under the current structure? Zero.

Figured that CS might be a better fit for me. But then **I thought closely about why I hated the courses, and realized that generally in upper years I prob won't see them again** (lets be real, I don't really care about electromagnetism when compiling my code other than whether or not my computer is on or not, or whether or not I have to prove random mathematical shit), and that transferring to CS is not a guarantee. Most importantly I'm gonna be leaving my friends that I made in first year. But most important reason was the one I bolded, which convinced me to stay in hopes that it would get better.

You also need some time management skills to average out the load over the term so there is no catastrophic failure at the end of the term.

For example, some might find anything math and science related as “easy”, while others struggle at it. Similarly, there are those who excel at business courses and those who bomb it.

Another note is that the difficulty of courses can vary greatly depending on your school (even if it’s the same curriculum). I’d recommend asking upper year students at your school for suggestions on which course gives out high marks regularly (this will be much more accurate then any advice you will find on Reddit).

Your teacher is also extremely important. For my school, there was this AP physics teacher who basically gave out 100s to everyone, while the academic teachers were significantly more strict in comparison. So be sure to research this as well.

If you want actual course suggestions, I recommend (at least for my high school):

-	Data management
-	Computer Science
-	Physics
-	Accounting
