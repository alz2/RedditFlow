http://pizzapurista.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/HOCH-HYDRIERTE-TEIGE2-1200x800.jpg

Sadly, this kind of pizza requires a really high hydration, ideally above 80% (for comparison, regular pizzas have about 58% hydration).

For the decoration I roll out the pastry and freeze it. I made a template with tracing paper. I marked the outline onto the pastry and then carved the details out with a scalpel. I did really shallow cuts and then sort of scraped the top layer of pastry away where I wanted it darker. I've seen people sculpting the pastry with an icing modelling tool, but I haven't tried it myself. Then cut the outline out, transfer to an (egg washed) pie lid and egg wash the details. I use a full egg for the wash and make sure that the details are well covered and essentially the little trenches are filled with egg, so they cook dark. Put the pastry back in the freezer when it starts to warm up too much and drag.

Peanut butter is a healthy option for snacks, to spread on toast for breakfast etc..  

&amp;#x200B;

Super natural Peanut Butter Ingredients: 

\- peanuts ‚Äì 2 cups; 

\- salt ‚Äì a pinch.  

Note: To sweeten, you can add 1-2 tbsp jaggery or dates while grinding. Though I prefer it to be all natural without added sweetener. Pls avoid adding refined sugar. This peanut butter stays upto two months in the fridge or maybe even longer if stored in an airtight glass container. It stays good at room temp for 3 days, I recommend you to keep in the fridge to prevent any mould formation.

binqd8,em1qa2h,Dirt_x3,1,2019-04-29 05:04:04,"Poke (poh-kay) is a popular traditional hawaiian dish consiting of cubed raw fish, either plain or with various seasonings. Ahi (ah-hee), aka: tuna, is usually the choice of fish used in this dish. Pictured above is a poke bowl, which is poke served on top/with rice. This poke style is a personal favorite known as ""california"" which is sold in local supermarkets called Foodland or Sack'N'Save. The poke is made with diced ahi, mayo, imitation crab, flying fish row/caviar, cucumber, avacado, white and green onions, and furikake (dried seaweed shreads, seasame seeds, salt, sugar). If you ever come to visit here in hawaii and you love to eat seafood, i would highly recommend that you try it. Poke is usually sold in supermarkets if your on a budget. Or you can seek out fancy restaurants that sever higher quality dishes. Even if your not able to visit, feel free to try it at home. Fairly simple to prepare and you can season it however you want.

Ahi (ah-hee), aka: tuna, is usually the choice of fish used in this dish. Pictured above is a poke bowl, which is poke served on top of rice. This poke style is a personal favorite known as ""california"" which is sold in local supermarkets called Foodland or Sack'N'Save. The poke is made with diced ahi, mayo, imitation crab, flying fish row/caviar, cucumber, avacado, white and green onions, and furikake (dried seaweed shreads, seasame seeds, salt, sugar). If you ever come to visit here in hawaii and you love to eat seafood, i would highly recommend that you try it. Poke is usually sold in supermarkets if your on a budget. Or you can seek out fancy restaurants that sever higher quality dishes. Even if your not able to visit, feel free to try it at home. Fairly simple to prepare and you can season it however you want.

Recipe adapted from Daily Delicious. You can Google ""double fromage cake recipe"" for their detailed step-by-step photos.

Makes one 7"" cake.

Lemon cake base:

Use your favorite non-butter lemon cake recipe. ¬†Non-butter is preferred because cake is served cold, and butter cakes tastes hard and dry when served cold.


Baked cheese cake

220 g Cream cheese, soft

80 g Granulated sugar

60 g Whipping cream

1 Egg (large about ¬†65-70 g)

1 Egg yolk (from a large egg)

1/2 tsp Vanilla extract

6 g or 1 tablespoon Cake flour (optional, can also replace with regular flour or cornstarch)

¬º cup to ‚Öì cup berry jam (I used a mix of Saskatoon berry and black currant)


Beat the cream cheese until smooth, add the granulated sugar and beat until smooth.

Pour the whipping cream, egg, egg yolks and vanilla extract into the bowl, beat until mixture is uniform.

Sift the flour into the bowl.
Fold with a spatula until smooth.

Put in half of the berry jam and fold a couple of times.
Pour over baked lemon cake.

Dollop the remaining berry jam and swirl it around. Most of it will sink to the bottom, it's ok.


Bake in 150 C /300F preheated oven for 20-30 minutes or until the side of the cake set but the center still movable slightly.


Let it cool completely.


Spoon another ¬º cup of berry jam on top before pouring on the mascarpone mousse.


Mascarpone mousse:

142 g Mascarpone cheese

81 g Granulated sugar

40 g ¬†Egg yolks (about 2 large)

30 g Water

75 g Whipping cream (A)

255 g Whipping cream (B)

5 g Gelatine (I used Knox brand)


Bloom the gelatine in cold water, for at least 5 minutes.


Beat the egg yolks and cream (A) with sugar over double boiler until hot and dissolved. ¬†Stir bloomed gelatin into egg mixture until fully melted. If you accidentally overcooked some egg yolks, strain the mixture to remove the cooked yolk bits. Cool for a few minutes.


Whip the whipping cream (B) until soft peaks formed. Set aside.


In the same bowl, beat the mascarpone cheese until smooth, pour the warm egg mixture into the bowl and beat until well combined.


Fold 1/3 of the soft whipped cream into cheese mixture.


Fold in the rest of the whipped cream until combined.


Pour most of it over cheesecake base and set overnight.


Keep the leftover cream refrigerated for frosting the cake's sides later.",/r/food/comments/bijhfv/homemade_saskatoon_berry_and_black_currant_double/em201gf/,NaN,0.926,0.057,0.017

The stuff:
1 cup plus 1/2 cup water
1/2 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons ginger paste
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons cornstarch
7 tablespoons granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground Szechuan peppercorns 
1/4 teaspoon black pepper (fine grind)
1/4 teaspoon coriander
3 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon lime juice


How to do it: 
Before starting the sauce prepare the Szechuan peppercorns by toasting around 2 tablespoons in a saut√© pan over medium heat for 5 minutes or until fragrant and slightly darkened. Grind the toasted peppercorns in a spice grinder, coffee grinder, or mortar and pestle until fine, and then sift it through a wire mesh strainer to remove the big pieces.

Make the sauce by combining 1 cup of water with soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, garlic and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat. When the mixture begins to bubble reduce the heat and simmer for 12 minutes. Cover the pan and let the mixture steep for 12 minutes, then pour the sauce through a wire mesh strainer. Add the strained sauce back into the saucepan.

Mix 2 tablespoons of cornstarch into the remaining 1/2 cup of water until dissolved. Pour this slurry into the saucepan along with the sugar, ground Szechuan peppercorns, black pepper, and coriander. Heat over medium until bubbling, then reduce the heat and simmer for 3 minutes. It should be much thicker. Remove the sauce from the heat and let it cool for 3 minutes, uncovered.

Add the vinegars and lime juice, and let it cool down before using. Store the sauce covered in your refrigerator. Stir well before using.",/r/food/comments/bipj40/homemade_schesuan_sauce/em23m60/,NaN,0.92,0.057,0.023

Ingredients 

Meatballs 
Ground Veal
Ground Beef 
Ground Pork
Parsley 
Ricotta 
Worcester sauce 
Breadcrumbs 
Pinch of salt
(I don't really use measurements I kinda just eyeball how much I feel is good but generally a half pound of each meat produces about 20-25 1.5 inch diameter meatballs)

Sauce
1/2 Onion diced into small pieces 
Can of crushed tomato sauce 
Olive oil just a dash 
Salt 
1/2 tsp sugar

Bread
Any bread is fine

Pretty straight forward just mix all the ingredients together thoroughly and continue to add Worcester sauce and bread crumbs while mixing cook at 425 degrees C till they are cooked through 

Sauce 
Onions in pan let the brown then add the sauce reduce heat to medium add your oil, sugar and salt once the meatballs are cooked add them in 

Presentation

bip4a2,em2mjwo,zombie_girraffe,1,2019-04-29 12:32:34,"\&gt;   it's important to understand the concept of which ever cooking methods you use 

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, it is, and the only reason to rest the steak when cooking sous vide is if you're worried about over cooking it during the sear.

&amp;#x200B;

To understand why, it's important to understand why you rest meats before serving them in the first place.  When cooking using traditional methods such as grilling or roasting at high temperature, a significant temperature gradient occurs in the steak.  The outside of the steak will be much higher temperature than the center of the steak.  This temperature gradient causes the protein fibers on the outside of the steak to contract and squeeze some of their moisture into the cooler center part of the steak, where the protein fibers are more relaxed due to the lower temperature.  The purpose of the rest is to allow the temperature gradient to even out so that center warms up a bit and the outside cools down a bit.  That relaxes the proteins on the outside, allowing it to reabsorb some of the extra moisture that was forced out at the higher temperature.

&amp;#x200B;

When cooking sous vide, there is no such temperature gradient in the steak, so there is no point in resting it.  The minimal temperature gradient added during the sear is effectively rested out in the time it takes to walk the steak from the kitchen to the table.",/r/food/comments/bip4a2/homemade_sous_vide_steak/em2mjwo/,NaN,0.872,0.082,0.046

- Let steak sit at room temp for half an hour. 
- Pat down moisture with paper towel.
- Season entire surface area of steak quite liberally with fresh cracked pepper and kosher salt.
- Preheat to 500-525 degrees. 
- Cook on one side for 4 minutes, turning the steak at a 90 degree angle 2 minutes into the 4 minutes. Flip over steak after the 4 minutes and repeat. 
- Turn steak on its side and let grill for another minute. Roll it slightly, one more minute. Turn off heat. Roll a final time and let continue cooking for one more minute with residual heat. The goal here is to get a sear/crust around the whole surface area.
- Let rest for 5 minutes covered in foil on a plate.
- The steak should be rare to medium rare depending on the thickness of the cut.
- Treat in broiler to get nice hot exterior, only a couple minutes on high. 
- Remove and enjoy immediately. This method has been working tremendously for me. $5 cuts are tasting like steakhouse cuts. I‚Äôm not sure if my grills temp gauge is accurate however.
- I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not a perfect even cook through with this method, but it‚Äôs been pretty damn even with a distinct crust that is flavorful and retains the juices of the steak.",/r/food/comments/bip4a2/homemade_sous_vide_steak/em2scvk/,NaN,0.809,0.111,0.08

Here's the recipe for it if you want to try it for yourself! It's really easy.  

Ingredients:   
300g flour

3g yeast  
30g sugar  
6g oil

- Mix the water and yeast together and let it sit for ~5 mins  
- Combine with all other ingredients  
- Knead for ~15minutes  
- Divide dough into 9 pieces (50g/bun). Roll buns out into a circle then brush oil on half. Fold the other half over  
- Let rest covered for 1 hour

1.5 lb chicken thighs, marinated with a little less than 2 tbsp smoked paprika, 3 garlic cloves, 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp acid (I used red wine vinegar because it‚Äôs all I had, but lemon or lime would be good too), 1 tsp salt, and a bit of pepper. Let it sit while you prepare the veggies.

Heat oven to 400 F. Line 2 sheet pans with foil and coat with some oil.

4 yellow potatoes and 1 sweet potato cut into small chunks, and 1 head of cauliflower (I used purple cauliflower for color) cut into florets a little larger than the potato chunks. I also added 2 sliced jalape√±os for some flavor and heat. Throw them all on the sheet pans and toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper.

Make room in the pans for the chicken, then bake for 30 mins.

Quickly pickle some thin red bell pepper slices in some vinegar, salt, and sugar.

Toss the potatoes and cauliflower to make sure they‚Äôre cooking evenly, and bake for another 10-15 mins. Throw the bell pepper slices on top, and sprinkle some cilantro over everything.",/r/food/comments/birqen/homemade_sheet_pan_chicken_potatoes_and/em33fad/,NaN,0.892,0.079,0.028

Pork Belly:  
Ingredients  
- 2lb pork belly  
- 1 onion, sliced 
- 1 cup Teriyaki sauce (1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup mirin, 1/2 cup sake, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup chopped onion, 5 thin slices of ginger, 2 cloves of garlic, smashed)   
- oil   

Instructions  
- Heat oil on a pan and brown the pork belly  
- Once browned, put onion and pork in a pressure cooker and pour enough water to cover it. cook for 30 mins. If you don't have a pressure cooker, you can cook it on a pan but it'll take a couple hours  - Remove pork from the pressure cooker, cut into pieces put into a pan   
- Add the teriyaki sauce over the pork and simmer until you can easily stick a knife or a skewer through the pork (around an hour)   

Teriyaki Sauce - combine all ingredients in a pot, bring to a boil then simmer for 8 minutes. Strain the sauce, removing the solid pieces.

bipiyu,em3w4xe,wicked_pissah,1,2019-04-29 20:57:08,"My understanding without looking up a more exact answer:  when the meat hits a certain temperature, it causes moisture to be pushed out, which evaporates off and cools the meat.  You can push through with a higher temperature to get over it and hit your temperature bogey, but you're losing moisture the entire time.

To avoid this moisture loss, you can wrap the meat with some covering to create basically a meat sauna, retaining more of that juice.

Some people used to call this a crutch in competitions, but I haven't heard anyone disparage the practice in the last five years or so because it works so well in getting you through the stall and maintaining moisture.",/r/food/comments/bipiyu/homemade_brisket_smoked_for_17_hours/em3w4xe/,NaN,0.821,0.088,0.091

When cooked to the correct temperature for an appropriate amount of time, you'll be rendering the fat in the muscles, which is where a large part of your moisture comes from (not to mention most of the flavor). Fat won't evaporate.

So wrapping (Texas crutch) basically just stops the evaporation process, but it also changes the texture (and flavor) of the meat, to an extent. Wrapping in foil is essentially braising the meat, like in a literal slowcooker. Brisket will come out almost like a pot roast when done that way. Wrapping in butcher paper allows the meat to breath more, so you get more of the beefy flavor.

Personally, I almost never wrap. I don't mind long cooks. Usually my briskets take 18-24 hours and they come out just as juicy as when I've tried wrapping.",/r/food/comments/bipiyu/homemade_brisket_smoked_for_17_hours/em3zymz/,NaN,0.944,0.044,0.013

8oz cream cheese
1 tablespoon honey 
1/2-3/4 cup cheddar shredded cheese 
1 clove fresh garlic minced 
Your favorite dry rub
1 roasted chili or jalape√±o skin removed and chopped

Flatten the meat out (can use any ground meat really but pork sausage and hamburger work best) experiment with different combos of meat and internals. The sky is the limit. You can also make a bacon weave and wrap fully in it as well. 

Make a large square evenly

Mix your ingredients in a bowl add the dry rub to your liking

Spoon filling into middle leaving space at ends. To create a burrito essentially. Use parchment or cling wrap and fold one half at a time over the filling. Pinch ends and smooth out seam.

Preheat smoker to 250. Use your favorite wood. Apple, hickory, cherry. 

Once smoking 5-15 minutes out on your meat tube. Smoke for 1.5-2.5 hours until internal temp between 150-165. 

Last 30 minutes use left over filling due to having plenty left over and spread out on foil. Smoke the cheese filling until browned then remove for nice snack with crackers. 

Last 15 minutes of the fatty cook you can add bbq sauce or a brown sugar glaze to finish. Not needed but can be nice. 

Remove and rest 5-10 minutes. Slice and enjoy.

Total Time: 25 minutes 
Category: Appetizer  
Yield: 15 individual eggplant slices 
Author: Shirin K

INGREDIENTS:
2 large eggplants
5 garlic cloves minced 
4 tablespoons white wine vinegar 
1 cup olive oil divided and extra to drizzle on top
Salt to sprinkle on top at the end 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
Cut the eggplants with the skin on into 1 inch thick slices. 
Grill the eggplants on high (I use an electronic grill) for 8 minutes. 
Use 3/4 cup of olive oil to fry the eggplants for 8 minutes. Turn halfway to make sure it is fully cooked on both sides. Remove when soft but before they are falling apart. 
Remove the eggplant and set on a paper towel to get rid of the excess oil.
Get rid of the remaining olive oil in the pan. Warm up the pan, add the 1/4 cup olive oil with the garlic. Cook for 1 minute and then add the vinegar to garlic and olive oil. Next, put the eggplants back in the frying pan and cook for about 2 to 4 minutes. This depends on how hot the pan is at this point. 
Remove from the pan, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt before serving.",/r/food/comments/bibm4u/homemade_fried_eggplant_appetizer/em44ec8/,NaN,0.949,0.034,0.017
