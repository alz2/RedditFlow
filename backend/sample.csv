t3_bgmqzv,eln2e76,sonixultra,1,2019-04-24 02:42:58,"First off a reasonable course load depends on your work ethic. If you're consistent, you'll do fine. I'm outlining courses you should definitely take below. If you feel that you can handle more, I've mentioned additional courses you can take. Don't make the mistake of slacking off your freshman year: you won't be able to recover from a bad gpa (no job for a while, sad reaxs only).

&amp;#x200B;

As for classes to take that would be ideal, it would depend on what you're interested in. If you're leaning more towards the CS side of things and want to get decent internships (over the summer), then prioritizing CS 225 and ECE 391 are a must. Both of these classes are pre-recs to many interesting 400 level CS(and cross-listed ECE) courses such as CS461/ECE422, ECE428 etc. CS225 also helps you land your first well paying job. You should also prioritize trying to get into CS 374 as soon as possible, which for CompEs is usually 1st semester Junior year. Material you learn in this class is regularly asked in FB/Amazon/Microsoft/Google interviews. If you're interesting in Machine Learning, then ECE 313 - which is an absolute shit class, should be taken earlier rather than later. You can also take STAT 400 + STAT 410 instead of 313. 

Regardless of your preference(leanings), as a CompE, I'd recommend the following courses for your freshman year:

&amp;#x200B;

First semester: ECE 120, Phys 211, calc 3, gen-ed. Although this doesn't sound like a lot, you need to get used to the pace of college: Calc 3 is a huge time sink, and ECE 120 requires you to be consistent (go to class for 120). Meeting people your first semester is important: getting to know your fellow engineers (whom you'll be studying with) pays off. So is making close friends and developing a social life: I still interact frequently with many of my friends I met my freshman year. If you think that you can handle more, take ECE 110 this semester too. 

Second semester: ECE 220, ECE 110, Physics 212, and a gen-ed or Math 286 (if you can fit it in). I think that they recently changed the rules for taking CS 225 and CS 173 concurrently: you need an A- minimum in ECE 220 so don't slack off. If you don't think that you can pull that off, then switch the gen-ed/286 for math 213, which is an alternative for CS 173. However this will bite you back when you take 374. You can also take Math 213 on top of the suggested courses above.

&amp;#x200B;

LPT: work hard over the summer after your freshman year. Pickup some useful skills like web-dev, mobile, node-js, react etc. Design something, work on any sort of project, and put your code up on github. Try applying for part time jobs at research park - it is a great way to get some experience. 

If at any point the courses above become too much, swap out physics and math for gen-eds. Prioritize ECE/CS classes first.

Third semester: CS 225, CS 173, gen-eds, perhaps math 286 here instead.  --GO TO HACKATHONS - as many as you can. After this semester, you'll be able to do decently well at interviews at the spring career fair.

Fourth Semester: ECE 391!!!!! or cs/ece 374 if you can get in.",/r/UIUC/comments/bgmqzv/computer_engineering_freshman_schedule/eln2e76/,NaN,0.88,0.092,0.027

 Extra credit:

1. As noted above, i&gt;clicker performance (correct answers) will be worth up to 2% extra credit. For each day, we'll divide your number of correct answers by the maximum number of possible points that day to get your percentage for the day. We'll then average all the day percentages to get your overall performance percentage, which we'll multiply by 2% and award as extra credit.
2. Discussion sections are organized into groups sharing a table. If you get &gt;= 8 points on a quiz, you get 1 point of extra credit for everyone else on your table who also got &gt;= 8 points. This extra credit counts towards the 2% for weekly quiz grades.
3. Some labs will have small extra credit components. Details will be present in those lab handouts.
4. On very rare occasions there are other opportunities for extra credit.

We had extra credit for a survey at the beginning of the semester, extra credit on some labs, extra credit homework assignments, and will have one more extra credit opportunity before the end of the semester.",/r/UIUC/comments/bgad83/exam_6_reacts_only/elndynx/,NaN,0.771,0.229,0.0

Fair warning: this isn’t about memes.

What if we had a mascot that was able to be a rallying point for the campus instead of a point of contention?
What if we had a mascot that spurred altruism instead of tribalism in a time when we have so many challenges that require coming together?
What if we had a mascot that was such a bold departure from normal that it faded any discussion about the chief into the background?
What if we carried on the “tradition” of retiring mascots in a way that made the Chief’s retirement part of a pattern of displays of respect?
I propose we have a mascot that has built into its selection a retirement. I propose we have a dynamic mascot whose embodiment changes over the years. I propose our mascot be a rotating selection off of the endangered species list.
We could run this one of two ways 1) the critter is our mascot for a set period of time or 2) the critter is our mascot until it is off the endangered species list.
Reasons this is a good idea:
1) We could have a portion of merchandise, ticket sales, etc. go to non-profits and charities that are actively working to help our mascot. Merchandise sales would have a built in way to stay fresh as the mascot changes; further spurring sales (I personally would probably try to collect pint glasses or something as they changed).
2) Doing something this different could have the potential to increase the overall appeal of the school and boost enrollment/applications.
3) How cool would it be if we could rally as a campus as our sports teams kick butt and bring awareness (and money) to this cause at the same time?
4) How cool would it be to look back on your time as an Illini and say “Oh, we were the Sage-Grouses and the Hawksbill Turtles when I was in school?” It would create a fun new way to relate to fellow Alums and talk about your time in school.
5) Having an endangered species as our mascot would play well into the “Fighting Illini” moniker as all endangered species are currently “fighting.”
6) It’s a bold enough move that it would dominate the discussion instead of the “bring back the Chief” arguments.
7) It’s a move that has an altruistic element that people can get behind instead of being divided.
8) Retiring Mascots could in time become a respectful tradition instead of an open wound.

As it is under the current system, they could still raise the rate more if desired, but that would effect everyone.

It sounds like your concern is more about future tax increases rather than the structure itself. Either way, the progressive system is far better than the flat tax, especially when considering future tax changes, because a progressive tax system allows for tax changes to more finely tuned on income brackets without drastically increasing the burden on the middle class (flat tax increase), or in the case of tax cuts, without drastically reducing revenue from the ultra wealthy (flat tax decrease).",/r/UIUC/comments/bgwfig/illinois_governor_pritzker_under_federal_criminal/eloohb9/,NaN,0.851,0.09,0.059

so basically it's: do you think that when people have dominant/strong opinions, does it hurt our ability to decide what is best for our environment? i'd suggest that you disagree, but do what you want...

then talk about how when white people have extreme opinions on what they want (in relation to nature), it typically hinders the way our land is managed. I haven't finished it so I don't have any specific quotes you could use (sorry) but an example to help you understand--which could very well be a piece of evidence in the materials, I'm just not sure--is how 'white people' want to use Native American sacred land for commercial use (ie. the pipeline) and they're so set on doing this that the native land is typically destroyed when it shouldn't have been.

Honestly, I think the most important tips for 241 are to start MPs early, write your code in small chunks and test often. Also, MPs are worth about 40% of the grade I think, but quizzes are 50% and fairly easy to do well on. Don't blow off the quizzes, start your MPs early (a day or two after they're assigned) and work in small increments, and it really isn't too hard to get an A.

As for 374, it's a challenge no doubt. But start early, go to OH, GO TO DISCUSSION. And practice the hell out of those problems. Good study techniques are really a game changer here.",/r/UIUC/comments/bh2j2g/i_read_the_posts_on_here_about_cs374_and_cs241/elq16q2/,NaN,0.746,0.152,0.103
