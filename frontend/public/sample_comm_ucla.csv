It’s almost laughable how strong the alumni network is. You’ll also have pretty prestigious internship opportunities available to you at UCLA that you won’t find at SDSU. Money is certainly a factor, but keep in mind that the MBA will run you $100k, unless you work for years and get your company to pay for it, which is hard to bank on. Having gone to law school and incurred a debt well into the six figures, I can tell you that the difference of $20-30k feels pretty fucking negligible at the moment. Honestly, run a cost / benefit.

Work study is a form of financial aid where half your pay is subsidized by the government.

Work study isn't something you can really apply for. It's given through financial aid when they see that your cost of attendance is greater than your family's means to pay. But you can appeal if you really think your FAFSA is unrepresentative of your family's true financial situation.

b7rz3z,em297j8,confirmedpenguin,1,2019-04-29 10:01:33,"Easily UCLA.

1. Class sizes aren't too bad. But you have to really think about why that matters in the first place. People love to say smaller class sizes are better because they allow for better interaction and getting to know your professor, forming connections etc. That's all BS. You go to lecture to learn. It doesn't matter if you hearing a lecture with 10 people or with 10,000 people with the professor projected on an overhead display, the content of the lecture is the same. Some professors, although not in the CS department, do the reverse and upload prerecorded lectures students watch at home and do other things during the allocated class time. If you recognize that you're only purpose of going to lecture is to absorb material, you'll realize it doesn't matter how many people are listening with you.

Also 90% of the time, the professor will not bother to learn your name. TA's on the other hand are a godsend. The unspoken rule is never to go to your professors office hours for homework help. You go if you have trouble on conceptual parts of the material or want to hear whatever stories they are telling. You go to your TAs for everything else. I've actually gotten lunch with some of my TAs after I had class with them and a lot of them recognize me even after I've taken their class. TA sections are also way smaller at around 30 people so it's easier to talk to them.

Anyway the huge class sizes are really only a thing in your first year. For the lower div series that everyone takes during their first year, the class size can get to as big as 200 people. But afterwards, the enrollment choices diverge a lot and class sizes get noticeably smaller. Of course required courses still have around 130 people but the electives I'm taking have closer to 70 people. If you still think 70 is a lot, refer to my first point.

What I said is probably only true for CS/south campus classes and probably doesn't really apply to North campus classes so take it with a grain of salt when thinking about enrollment in general.

2. Cut throat is a property of the people, not the content. In every class I've taken this year, I would just go to office hours and mingle with other people. More often than not, they're taking the class alone and are more than happy to join your study group. You just need to ask. Of course you might meet some people who don't think you're worth their time but shrug it off and go ask other people to join your study group.

3. The USC alumni network is basically where USC alumni help new grads get their foot in the door for whatever industry they're in. UCLA also has an alumni association but it's not as prevalent as USC's because it helps to be rich and have a lot of connections in the first place. That being said, the usefulness of the network depends on your major. If you want to go into business then that alumni network is invaluable and alumni connections could probably put you in touch with a lot of powerful people. However if you're in CS, it doesn't matter as much since your ability to land an internship is primarily dependent on your skills rather than connections.",/r/ucla/comments/b7rz3z/should_i_go_to_ucla_or_insert_school_here/em297j8/,NaN,0.875,0.102,0.023

The two years required for self-support might not coincide with the two tax years during which they must not have been claimed by their parents.

baau4s,em3mqp0,gros8433,1,2019-04-29 19:07:02,"Hi there. I am currently a senior pre-med student who is finishing up my time in an undergraduate lab. I also transferred to my university my junior year after the established labs at my university were already full of undergraduates. I ended up just asking one of my professors who was not doing active research at the time if I he would be willing to let me perform an independent research project in his lab. He ended up agreeing, and I got a full year of research experience my senior year of college. Working in a lab by yourself has its perks and downfalls, but sometimes you have to take what you can get. Also, you'd be surprised how many professors are willing to help out an undergraduate who shows initiative. I was also looking to get experience handling lab mice, so I reached out to a professor who ran a mouse lab and just asked if he needed any help changing the cages a few times a week. I started doing this my last semester of undergraduate. As transfers, it is easy to compare yourself to traditional undergraduates, but it is never too late to get undergraduate research experience, you just might have to do things a bit differently.

They should factor in the difficulty of the undergraduate school along with the major a pre-med student majors in. Especially factors such as the difficulty of the science majors here at UCLA.

I think pre-meds should go though the rigors of being a science major because well, medical school is all about science and physiology. Any non-science majors can put in their efforts to do very well at getting good grades for the basic requirements needed in medical school. But IMO, that shouldn't be the case. These are the things I think medical school should factor in.
