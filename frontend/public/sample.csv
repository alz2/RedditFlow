I'm not sure if itll be the same format but for me the format was

a bunch of mini assessments online for each lesson.  Very easy and small number of questions.

Then we had 3 projects 2 assignments.

Projects were 3.3% each had few questions were kind of tricky imo.

Assignments were 10% each and has many questions but they were straight calculations so easy.

You actually have lots of time to complete everything so it wasnt a stressful course.  The assignments accumulated to 40% of my grade and the rest was the final.

I had Owen Woody   he still hasnt returned 3/5 big assignments, some that weve done back in February and I still dont have my final mark.  He's also really slow at replying to emails so when I had a 39 fever for days and 2 infections and emailed him asking for an extension  for the 10% assignment, he didnt reply for 5 days and I ended up having to take a shit ton of pain killers and medication to grind all night to finish it sick af.

bijk1l,em23akp,Laeriana,1,2019-04-29 08:49:48,"I’ve had some experiences with all of these courses and have done my best to compile/link relevant responses for each of them. LOOOOOOOOOOOOONG REPLY INCOMING!

Of all the courses you've listed, I personally struggled with AMATH 250 the most. When I attempted the in-class version of the course, the first month or so was a lot of review and expansion of content seen in MATH 138. This was fine until things switched gears into brand new material that had a lot of physics concepts. I personally did not take physics in high school (not to mention I failed PHYS 121 spectacularly) so I was absolutely clueless as to what the problems were asking me for. I ended up WD-ing the course before the midterm because I just knew it wasn't the course for me. If you like calculus, and have at least had some exposure to physics-based concepts, you may fair better than I did, but I would not really recommend this course otherwise.

I took CO 480 with Steven Furino back in Spring 2015, and I wrote in more detail my experiences with the course in a [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/bbpp49/hows_steve_furino_as_a_co480_prof/). I really enjoyed the course, but would not recommend it if you're not a fan of writing and large group projects.

I took CS 200 with Barb Daly in Spring 2018, and I wrote more about my experience in [this thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/a8rrt7/how_is_barbara_daly_for_cs200/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). I really, really enjoyed this course, but the workload and effort does increase towards the end of the term, so be prepared to take extra time to get things done.

I took STAT 337 with Cecilia Cotton also in Spring 2018. The course itself focuses on how to understand statistics that are presented in a health/biological context (e.g. reading various studies findings and seeing if things made sense or not). The math itself was really straightforward (be prepared for a LOT of working with two by two tables in various statistical models) and you had the opportunity to bring in your own formula sheet for exams, but the most fun/challenging part of the course though was the group poster presentations. You got together in groups of 2-4 to examine a biostatistical topic (often, but not always health related) and present 3 academic papers that study the topic in one culminating poster. Not gonna lie, presenting in front of classmates at 8:30 am (yay class scheduling) AND getting the poster printed fully by then was quite stressful despite the project itself not being as intense in workload or worth as much of the final grade as the CO 480 project was. Overall though, I enjoyed the course and I was so happy and proud of the results of that project.

As for CS 432, I took this course quite a few years ago (i.e. around 2013/2014 or so) with a different prof, so I'm really not sure if my experiences are relevant for this upcoming offering. At the time, this course involved a lot of writing and coming up with solutions to project-based scenarios based on the concepts we were looking at in class. I found it pretty tedious, but so long as you went into as much detail as possible you could do well. Exams were easier than the written assignments, mostly because they focused on ""do you know this concept well enough?"".

Overall, I would strongly suggest taking CO 480 and CS 200, with a toss-up between CS 432 and STAT 337, but hopefully with all the info provided you'll be able to make a more informed decision.

If you give someone in their 4B term moderator, they lose some effectiveness once they graduate because even if they do check the subreddit everyday, they slowly lose the connection with the school (which makes it hard, from my experience, to moderate effectively). I want to emphasize that this doesn't close the door on 4th years though, in fact, I became a mod when I was in my 4A term. If a 4th year promises to commit at least a year, then the year doesn't matter - However if its someone in their 4B that wants to mod for 4 months then call it quits, whats the point right?

In terms of the mod team making the final call - its really to give us an ""excuse"" to pick people that weren't top rated by the community. Let's say we pick 3 people - the top 2 are almost guaranteed (and this is true, based on past experience) to be the top 2 candidates with the best vote record (i.e. the community picks, not us). However, as others have mentioned, the more popular/well known redditors on the subreddit may get an advantage, so we want to reserve a spot for someone who is just as qualified by not as known to the community. In terms of the 3rd guy, yeah I'm not going to sit here and tell you that we're going to pick someone that's 180 degrees from our views, but I also believe (and maybe you disagree) we're not going to sit there and be like ""yo lets find the most twofactorial-esque (or some other mod) person and pick them &gt;:)"". Also, we'd still take into account the community feedback on each person. So that being said, I want to see what you think - do you like the idea of having the top 2 community picks + 1 person picked by the mod team?

Honestly I personally hate the hate posts or low quality bait threads. I agree with you that they have no value added to the community and generally brings the sub down. However, what's insanely difficult is where to the draw the line - We don't want to allow the community to be polluted by those type of posts, but at the same time, we don't want to step into every post and police whats being said. So far we've taken a more hands off approach, and we let the community decide the more borderline cases (via reports). The straight up racist or hate posts though - we've removed them pretty frequently and I don't remember anything too controversial that we've left up. Let me know if I'm wrong about this though. 

I don't really know if I've answered anything (I feel like I've given non answers - sorry).

&gt; The reason we want to give lower years preference is because they are the ones that can be committed to the role for longer.

Not as well known by the community, but preferred by the mods over the community choices.  With no oversight by the community or ability to contest.  We both said that, just with different emphasis.  And when called on it, you justified it rather than evaluating it.  

Dot dot dot. Old boys network.  

&gt;So that being said, I want to see what you think - do you like the idea  of having the top 2 community picks + 1 person picked by the mod team?

I like the idea that there's some defined procedures instead of the current 'mods pick who they want, and great if the community agrees ahead of time'.  Because right now there's 3 picked by the mods and none by the community - right?

ajgddo,em2doge,jhorbulyk,1,2019-04-29 10:52:47,"About Me:

I'm a UWaterloo Co-op Grad who graduated in 2014.  I currently work in Germany at a small software company which now hires UWaterloo Co-op students.  We had one studen in the Fall of 2018, failed to match any in Winter 2019 and now have 2 starting in Spring 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

Which co-op community you're trying to reach?

I would say the various forms of communities:

\- Individuals who have relatively managerial experience who are now managing co-op students

\- Individuals who have experience navigating UWaterloo works/CECA/WaterlooWorks/UW Application packages (employer-side) and who have any tips or tricks to share

\- Other international employers who want to talk over the international aspect of UW Coop Hiring

\- Other UW employers who want to coalesce their CECA/WaterlooWorks/etc into more constuctive feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

Why I'm asking and What Information am I trying to get?

\- I'm in the process of putting together my expectations for incoming Co-op students about what makes ""outstanding"" vs ""excellent"" vs ""very good"".  I can find a lot of resources for help on the student side of the question but relatively few resources employer-side.  I was wondering if anyone had any good templates to share on that side.

\- I know in a few weeks I will get an email from CECA asking to set up student SMART goals?  It would be nice to chat with employers who have been successful with that rubrik or whether they have some more valuable rubrik that they have found useful.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm trying to accomplish:

Nobody can really help you narrow down your choices if you don't give them something to work with. Like I have a friend who transferred from ECE to CS, and they're enjoying that more now. But my sister who was taking a double degree switched her CS major to Business because she found that easier and more useful. I myself decided to stay in ECE because I was good with everything except the science courses which were only really in first year. 

Every program has its ups and downs, and everyone finds some programs easy while others difficult.

For example, some might find anything math and science related as “easy”, while others struggle at it. Similarly, there are those who excel at business courses and those who bomb it.

Another note is that the difficulty of courses can vary greatly depending on your school (even if it’s the same curriculum). I’d recommend asking upper year students at your school for suggestions on which course gives out high marks regularly (this will be much more accurate then any advice you will find on Reddit).

Your teacher is also extremely important. For my school, there was this AP physics teacher who basically gave out 100s to everyone, while the academic teachers were significantly more strict in comparison. So be sure to research this as well.

If you want actual course suggestions, I recommend (at least for my high school):

-	Data management
-	Computer Science
-	Physics
-	Accounting

birpyq,em3qwnc,GenesisTK,1,2019-04-29 19:56:04,"I'm not so sure this is a good idea, the idea/goal of 480 is a survey of the basic methods in Machine/Deep Learning that are used in the industry. Boosting/Bagging are fairly theoretical concepts. What I mean by this is they've got some serious theory behind why they work/do not work well in a bunch of situations. Even the most fundamental proof about Boosting, i.e. That you can take a set of weak learners and ""make"" them a strong learner is too much theory for a student whose last math course is likely Math 138.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to think it was a good idea to be exposed to as much difficult material as was possible in a 4th year course, but after talking to some Profs, it's become abundantly clear that most students just want to ""Know All of Machine Learning"", and know how/when to use them.

&amp;#x200B;

Even something like ""Why are Neural Networks Universal Function Approximators"" is a proof that reasonably involved and requires a good deal of prerequisite material before it's proved. Or another simple question which is ""Why do CNN's work well?"" has had papers using Mean Field Theory/Renorm Group and other intense areas of math being used to actually find some sort of pattern.

&amp;#x200B;

This term, I audited \~ 4-5 lectures of CS 886 - Theory of Deep Learning, and my takeaway is that most people are interested in the theory of neural networks until you actually see how much material needs to be built up to properly understand it (even at a superficial level). I guess you could argue in favour for ""proof by pictures"" and ""proofs by examples"" but I'm afraid those are proofs you can do yourself in the comfort of your own home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/birpyq/cs_480680_grades_wow/em3qwnc/,NaN,0.852,0.107,0.04

9uhk57,em3w6g3,stressedoutmaxedout,1,2019-04-29 20:57:40,"Depends on your school. I’d recommend taking one or two easy courses in nightschool because it’s even easier there (so if you don’t wanna go to Waterloo then take nightschool courses cuz they’re easy marks).
That being said, easy courses are usually from this history/geo/family studies department.
1) Families in Canada (did it in night school, got 97)
2) Challenge and Change in Society (friends are doing it in night school, most are getting 95+)
3) Social Justice And Equity (easy course, it’s M tho, never took it but heard it’s easy)
4) World Issues (kinda like Social Justice, way better tho, my teacher made it so interesting and fun, this is a U course, ended off with 86 in day school)
6) International Business (friends are all getting 90s in day school)
7)Business Leadership (90s in day school again)
8) Econ, surprisingly. Apparently if you took gr11 Econ then gr12 is just that w a few more stuff.
9) Writers Craft, if you’re good at english and creativity take it. Kinda risky tho, english is really subjective so if the teacher doesn’t like your writing style you could easily flop the course.
10) Kinesiology.....idk ab this one. Everyone says it’s easy....it is in a sense, lots of memorization but you can do good in it even if you memorize the night before. It’s really dry tho....i absolutely hate the course, hate the teacher because she makes no effort to make it enjoyable. I hardly go to class (maybe once a week, sometimes never lol) and I’m still getting a 74. If it was up to be id have dropped it but I already have a spare. BUT ONLY take this if you’re good at memorization, there is no way around memorizing.
11) Food and Nutrition (don’t have much to say about this but friends got good marks in day school )
12) Peer Leadership and Fitness. Man...every single teacher hates this course LOL, they all say it’s the most useless course for students to get high marks in. You like gym and can work well with people? Take this. You can’t use gr12 gym as Top6 but you can use this cuz it’s a U course and it’s more than gym, my school’s PLF class mentors gr9 gym kids for a week, organizes a yearly fundraising assembly, goes to Bark Lake for 2-day trip. Everyone who had it formed really close bonds w each other..only take if you’re up for physical activity and cooperation tho. 
Anyway, it really depends on your teacher and how they are. Ask around from ppl that currently have it...ask them if the teachers are easy, if they’re NICE, if they put in the effort to actually engage kids in the class. These light courses are supposed to be easy marks but asking supposed to classes you can enjoy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/9uhk57/admissions_megathread_fall_2019_incoming_students/em3w6g3/,NaN,0.75,0.191,0.059

bix0xt,em3wek1,Laeriana,1,2019-04-29 21:00:26,"Three words (from my completely biased opinion): **ABSOLUTELY worth it.**

Even though I myself have had some lows with Accessability Services (mainly them losing/misplacing final exams, which is usually not fun), the fact that I'm being accommodated means I am MUCH more likely to pass courses than fail them as a result of my learning challenges. Before being accommodated, I would hand in exams mostly blank because my learning challenges kept me from answering within the commonly allotted exam times. I'll never forget writing my CS 116 midterm, because that was the first exam I was ever accommodated for. I felt like I could succeed, because I had the time to work with/through my learning challenges and finally get my answers on the page before the clock ran out. MY GOODNESS was it an amazing feeling to finally hand in an exam that wasn't mostly blank!

I myself had an assessment done in 2011, and at the time the Feds Health Plan covered most of it. From what I remember, I think I ended up only paying somewhere around $200 instead of $2,000. I'm not sure if the Feds Health Plan coverage has changed, but look into that as an option!

Once the assessment's final reports were submitted, I became a permanently registered student with Accessability Services and I've been accommodated ever since, but I would also note, that for myself, it took about 8 months or so to fully get my assessment processed. During that time my assessment was processing, I was eligible for temporary Accessability accommodations, so I would totally recommend having a talk with one of the advisors there to see if that would be an option for you. 

Overall, it's up to you on whether or not you feel going through the process is worth it. It was worth it for me, because I am significantly less likely to fail classes as a result. You've made it this far by yourself, but it doesn't hurt to get help if you feel you really need it in this way. If you had any more specific questions, I'd be happy to provide more insight but I hope that helps at least a little!",https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/bix0xt/anyone_registered_with_accessability_services/em3wek1/,NaN,0.838,0.132,0.031

I did not receive any other accommodations until the assessment was completed, and there was constant check-ins to make sure I was still on track to complete the assessment (because temporary is meant to mean temporary) and Accessability Services wants to ensure their services aren’t being taken advantage of.

Oh wow, that is a big difference several years makes in terms of costs. That said, the cost could be that way based on the type of assessment you’ve requested and/or the nature of the assessment referral. Mine was a general investigative assessment to test for all kinds of learning challenges (since the evaluators really had nothing to go on aside from what I was able to tell them) and I had it done based on a preliminary assessment and referral from Health Services. Are you getting the assessment referral through Health Services or are you getting it through a different provider’s recommendation? Not sure if that may be another option worth pursuing to see if the cost can be mitigated that way, but it’s there for your information.

I have never been OSAP eligible, so I am unsure how reimbursements could work on that front. The Accessability advisors likely know more, but I’m sorry I can’t help on that front.

All things considered, it really is up to you on whether or not you wish to pursue the assessment. Even if I had to do it all over again, I would personally gladly pay the full amount of money for the assessment, but that is my perspective with hindsight and the 8 years ish of history I’ve had as an Accessability Student.
