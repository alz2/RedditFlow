bikhxa,em1h6ht,Schwiftyyy,1,2019-04-29 01:09:40,"Hello there, I graduated with an English degree from A&amp;M, albeit a few years ago now. 

My honest advice? If you're taking on debt for a college degree, don't major in English. No, there's no stigma at A&amp;M or anything like that, but unless you plan on teaching English, it's just not a good investment of money (even if you're teaching, it's still not great). 

I loved almost every English class I had at A&amp;M, it's nothing against the department. But when I graduated, there just weren't any opportunities in non-saturated fields. I was lucky to be able to fall into being a sysadmin thanks to some summer work I did at A&amp;M.

I don't know you, so I'll stop trying to give you advice. I just...I wish someone had been straight with me when I started getting my degree. So that's all I'm trying to do here.

bikhxa,em1lamg,bigsur0120,1,2019-04-29 02:45:03,"Howdy, 

I was technically in General Studies at the time, but wanted to pursue biology. I hated chemistry, so I transferred to International Studies. I haven’t looked back since then. All of my classes were great, no regrets. I was also a former officer of Liberal Arts Student Council (not student government, a student organization), so I am pretty familiar with the school since I worked with them in the past advocating for LA students. I will be graduating this semester with plans to attend law school. 

It’s not that difficult to transfer to a Liberal Arts Major, at least from my experience. You only need a 2.5 GPA and 30+ hours completed or something like that, however, it’s been a while since I’ve looked at the requirements. If you google transfer requirements for majors at TAMU, you’ll find a PDF explaining it each degree’s transfers requirements.  You can also check out the TAMU degree catalog online. 

If you plan to get an English degree, you’re pretty limited to teaching, sales, insurance, consulting, staffing agencies (don’t ever work at one). 

A lot of people that I know within the liberal arts college in various majors have goals to pursue a graduate degree whether it’s law or some sort of master’s program. Some even go into the Peace Corps, Teach for America, Americorps, etc. A few go into intelligence, FBI, police academy, politics. 

I know that the people I personally know or have encountered in Liberal Arts is not fully representative of the entire population, but hopefully that provides a glimpse of post-graduate plans for some people.  The career services website provides data on the types of jobs liberal arts majors gravitate to after graduation. 

I’m in favor of choosing a degree you’re reasonably interested in rather than doing something you hate (and also do well in). You have at least till your sophomore year to change your major, just focus on taking your core classes, you’ll figure it out. 

If you have any questions about liberal arts in general &amp; political science (I’ve taken a few classes for my degree), pm me!",/r/aggies/comments/bikhxa/experiences_transferring_from_stem_to_liberal_arts/em1lamg/,NaN,0.833,0.116,0.051

I understand how difficult it could be, probably you’re just burned out? I’d definitely take a lesser load for one semester and try out general Liberal Art courses as that might help you decide if you ultimately want to leave engineering. 

For me it was ultimately a question of - do I want to leave STEM because the workload is hard? Or do I want to leave because the material doesn’t spark joy? I’m not saying this is happening to you, but just a perspective from someone who had this very same question years ago.

If you're looking for friends, stay in smaller, social oriented organizations. Good places to start are major specific ones. The larger organizations with a ""purpose"" or ""mission"" like Fish Camp, CARPOOL, Big Event, and others that aren't coming to mind, are good for awhile, but if you don't play the politics right and end up outside the cliques that control them, they can be downright terrible to be in.

&gt;What is on the math placement exam, how does it work, and exactly how much math can you test out of?
The MPE is just up to precalculus. It just makes sure that you are ready for Cal 1 according to their standards, you're not actually testing out of anything. If you don't pass, they place you in pre-cal for a semester. 

&gt;Will I have to cram these courses in as well? I’d hate to not be able to pursue a math major just because I can’t open enough credit hours to fit in humanities. :(
CE also requires the humanities courses. I'm not sure what you were looking at, but you definitely have to take (or use AP credits on) a certain number of hours on core courses like history, fine arts, etc. Most likely these would work for both majors, so you won't have to take them twice. 

&gt;Finally, how/when do I finalize things? How do I know for sure if I will be able to double major?
Ask your advisors at your NSC. I'm not sure about the math major, but for engineering you will actually have to complete a year of general engineering and then at the end of your freshman year, apply to the specific engineering that you want. A 3.5 GPA will give you an auto admit, anything lower than that depends on the specific major.

17 credit hours for ECEN/CEEN is a guaranteed 60 hours minimum of work every week, and realistically it's a max load. You'll probably find yourself wanting to take 13-15 hours a semester if possible for the sake of grades and/or free time, and anything above 17 hours is a no go. Those kind of semesters usually end with a withdrawal from one of the classes.

Getting a minor in math as a CEEN is a layup, as it only takes one extra class on top of your degree requirements, but I would book at least one extra semester for a math major, unless you can just legit go full wunderkind and test out of five classes in the A&amp;M math sequence before you even start your first year.

A remark about the genius thing: I'm really not one. There is a story behind where I am today in terms of math, but in short, if you like to do something, it's really not that big of a deal to spend some extra time doing it, and if you are consistent long enough, you will eventually make progress.

I know it probably sounds naive asf to think I could double major in math. I'm well aware that few people double major at all. I've been clinging to the hope that this was just because people don't try, but I definitely realize now that it may be impossible, which is a bit disheartening tbh.

Realistically you are only going to use one of those two degrees so in practice it's just a lot of extra work for a degree you won't use. I'd encourage you to just do stuff outside school if you are interested (either compE or math, whichever you don't major in). The knowledge is still worth learning, the only difference is you don't have a degree in it. You can even put it on your resume depending how much you self teach, you just can't say you have a degree in it. I was similar with getting a minor/double in mechanical but in the end I just took a couple basic classes to learn the fundamentals and then taught myself more specific stuff on my own through projects and whatnot. I learned enough about aerospace engineering on my own to get a job doing pretty much an aerospace engineers job but using my compE degree as the foundation. 

The degree is what qualifies you to do a job but your knowledge is what gets you the job. Major in what will open the most doors in your field of choice and then self teach yourself the specifics that will make you a good candidate for the job. Join clubs related to whatever field you want to get into, do projects, read textbooks, etc.

Now, I said earlier that I've ""done math."" While I do do a lot of math, I can't say I have done much ""real"" math. Namely, I haven't done too much proof based math outside of linear algebra.

Also, I am no genius. There are so many people that are so much better than me at math, part of me feels as if I wouldn't belong in a career in mathematics.

Not sure if you are aware but you do not have to take an AP class in order to take the AP test. I took some AP tests without the class in high school and know this can be done. So if you want that credit for at least some of those math classes you can do it, just make sure to register for the AP tests before its too late.

One other thing you should look into is engineering entry to a major requirements or ETAM. They will require you to take two math, two science, two engineering classes at tamu.

I had no programming experience going into the class and in fact hated the idea of even trying to learn to code, so I was kinda pissed when I learned that my whole first semester was gonna be coding.

However, after we started working on the assignments, I found out that it was really just a problem solving class.  They teach us all these Python commands and tell us to write a program to do X.

Imagine it sort of like putting together a puzzle with a bunch of different pieces, where there are multiple ways to finish it.  If you are good at thinking laterally this class won't be particularly difficult.

I was originally a math major and then added computer science to my degree plan because it would help me in grad school (I want to get an MS CS which uses a lot of advanced math.) But higher level math is no joke and I wouldn't want any other engineering student to go through my coursework because making time for a social life, extra curriculars, and trying to maintain a decent GPA is overwhelming for me personally. I wouldn't wish it on anybody.

I think that the time you spend on higher level math courses can be used to network or on extra curriculars. There's no need to rush or test out of classes. Make friends that are your class year. You only go through college once (usually) and you're going to regret spending all your time studying then getting out there.",/r/aggies/comments/bis74h/mathengineering_double_major_questions/em45y59/,NaN,0.841,0.105,0.054
