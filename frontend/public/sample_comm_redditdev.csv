bif5n3,em24f4u,DroneDashed,1,2019-04-29 09:04:07,"I catch the `praw.exceptions.APIException` and then try to parse it to get the time.

Here is an example of the function I use. It searches the message for minutes to wait and it waits those minutes + one. I did this because I found out that if the message said 3 minute it could be 3 minute 20 seconds, so to be safe and avoid another exception, I wait a full extra minute.

The message also returns seconds to wait but again, for the same reason, I always wait one minute to be safe.

You can easily tweak this function and look for seconds too.

    def try_get_seconds_to_wait(self, ex_msg=None):
            try:
                msg = ex_msg.lower()
                search = re.search(r'\b(minutes)\b', msg)
                minutes = int(msg[search.start()-2]) + 1

At line 4, `subreddit` (or `i`) will just be `test` (the literal string ""test"").

`subreddit.stream.submissions()` should be `reddit.subreddit(subreddit).stream.submissions()`.

In all

    subreddit_list = ['test']

    for sub in subreddit_list:
        for post in reddit.subreddit(sub).stream.submissions():

That said, you'd probably be better off with a multireddit instead of needing to have multiple streams to cover all the different subs, like

    subs = reddit.subreddit(""test+test2+test3"")
    for post in subs.stream.submissions():
        # stuff

and if you need to do different things per sub

    subs = reddit.subreddit(""test+test2+test3"")

        if post.subreddit == ""test"": # do test stuff
