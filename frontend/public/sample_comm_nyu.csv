bith9h,em3luww,amperstance,1,2019-04-29 18:56:27,"I ultimately didn't transfer. In the semester right before I was supposed to withdraw and transfer, a few things happened. For one, NYU adjusted my financial aid package and gave me another scholarship that made it essentially a full-ride. I am the only one I know who has a ""full"" ride to NYU without being sponsored by their government or having family working at NYU. (This might happen to you too! I hear colleges that get news that you were offered a seat somewhere else might adjust your scholarship to entice you to stay.) You can PM me if you want to hear more.

As a senior now, I'm content with my choice. I don't want to bias your judgement so I'll just stick to my experience freshman year. I got very lucky with my advisor at NYU freshman year and she cared very deeply for the well-being of the students. However, this is atypical and I've heard stories of advisors that won't reply to your email if they think you could have found the information elsewhere. It sounds like your advisor kind of sucks too. In general, it feels that many departments at NYU don't care for their undergraduate students. I don't know if Cornell would be any different, but for one of the other students who I know took the transfer offer, this was the primary reason he left NYU. On the other hand, I think the city is just a much better place to be for learning and growing into adulthood and there are more internship and research opportunities here. If you do well at NYU, you'll go on to do great things even without the Ivy League tag to your name. I have classmates who got into Ivy League med schools, grad schools like Oxford, and tech companies that would pay them to take semesters off to work for them instead. Also I think NYU is a little less pretentious about people who actually fucking study and are proud of it and not ""oh ho ho I started studying for my final last night and look here I got a 98 im an absolute genius."" (Obviously there are those types everywhere, but maybe less at NYU.) 

You can PM me for more! I'd be happy to share with you my experiences and reasons for staying versus transferring.",/r/nyu/comments/bith9h/tandon/em3luww/,NaN,0.869,0.117,0.013
